### Features of MAV

- **Visualization of Subtle Motions:** Amplifies minor vibrations and movements, making them visible for analysis.
- **Non-Invasive Monitoring:** Requires only video recording of the motor, eliminating the need for physical sensors.
- **High Sensitivity:** Capable of detecting low-amplitude vibrations that are indicative of early-stage faults.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Provides immediate feedback on motor condition, enabling prompt maintenance actions.
